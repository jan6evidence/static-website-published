They lifted up my gas mask and sprayed me in the face beating us in the head with batons. So we knew we couldn\'t get through the doors. So we broke the window got into the room. At that point it was all over my hair my face, I couldn\'t breath, I couldn\'t see. So I, we had to come up with a plan. And we barricaded the doors broke everything so we had something to use against them. While we were in there trying to come up with a plan, I was useless so I left. What ended up happening was a man\'s father called him from the outside and said the media is calling it anarchists. And what that means is they now have access to use deadly force against us. We lost lives in there. Two confirmed lives have been lost. Patriots we took the capitol and we\'re not stopping. I will be back tonight.
