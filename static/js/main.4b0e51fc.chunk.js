They lifted up my gas mask and sprayed me in the face beating us in the head with batons. So we knew we couldn\'t get through the doors. So we broke the window got into the room. At that point it was all over my hair my face, I couldn\'t breath, I couldn\'t see. So I, we had to come up with a plan. And we barricaded the doors broke everything so we had something to use against them. While we were in there trying to come up with a plan, I was useless so I left. What ended up happening was a man\'s father called him from the outside and said the media is calling it anarchists. And what that means is they now have access to use deadly force against us. We lost lives in there. Two confirmed lives have been lost. Patriots we took the capitol and we\'re not stopping. I will be back tonight.

Escalating violent attack on police at Arch Entrance on Lower West Terrace. Sticks. Bats. Flagpoles. Attack on Officer #5586 B.A. Miller. Fighting begins around :50 CW: at the 4:00 mark, an unconscious body at top of stairs by left railing appears to be dragged to police (grey shoe, jeans). As she and her friend were in this area in earlier footage, it is very likely that this was Rosanne Boyland, who was trampled to death. The person does seem to be wearing blue jeans and grey shoes like Roseanne Boyland was that day. This shows the attack from a somewhat distant vantage on the left of the steps. I lined up this video with a 16:27:06 timestamped image from Lev Radin. The image appears to align with the 1:06 minute mark on the video, which means this video takes place from 16:26-16:31 or thereabouts. Some people crawl in window.  People chant \\"I Can\'t Breathe\\".
