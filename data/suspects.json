Eyeglasses with black frames and a full, white beard fit with the early 2021 interview picture we've had for a while. On January 6 he was also wearing a short brown jacket with a wide collar and large, off-white cuffs and an inner lining that are all off-white. Under this was a shirt with a white top half and a red bottom half. The shirt has a small black logo over the left breast and it either has a black collar or is worn over a black shirt.
